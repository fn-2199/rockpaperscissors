Project: Rock Paper Scissors from TheOdinProject

This is the first project in which I was able to put my newfound Javascript skills to test along with HTML and CSS. At first, they had us code the logic and see the results from the console. Thereafter, they had us refactor our script in order to create a UI. Revising my js code was suprisingly easy. The big difference being I had to accept input from an image click rather than from an input prompt. In addition, I utilized the textContent method in order to update the scoreboard and announce the results of the game.

Some features that I've implemented that weren't required for this project were disabling text selection, playing audio when hovering and clicking on elements, deactivating the game after it has ended, activating the Retry button which reloads the page. Some of the new and useful CSS properties that I learned were cursor, blur, filter, and text-transform.
